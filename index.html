          This <s>is</s> hopefuly will be where I host my "stream of
          consciousness" blog. My more structured and education-focused
          technical writing can still be found

        <summary>Why does it look like shit?</summary>
        <p>
          Like many programmers, I have a lot of side projects I'd like to work
          on. One of them was my personal blog. I used to write regularly (<a
            href="https://yakkomajuri.medium.com/"
            >here</a
          >), but I've almost completely stopped for a while now. Many times I
          started to work on a blog, but my ideas were so grandiose that I
          wasn't finding time to execute them. So, in an effort to force me to
          get started, I told myself I'd built the simplest possible blog and
          kick things into motion.

        <summary>Why is it called 'Sunday Afternoon'?</summary>
        <p>
          Sunday afternoons are often when I'm most contemplative, as well as
          when I generally have the most time to spare. They have traditionally
          been when I develop my best concepts for writing, so the blog name
          felt appropriate. The bulk of the time I spend on this blog will also
          probably happen on sunday afternoons.

    <h3>Pictures</h3>

    <p>
      As someone who does not have a social media presence, I'll be using this
      blog to display some of my favorite pictures. Below is a quick teaser while I
      build this out.
