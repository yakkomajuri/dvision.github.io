Mount Kinabalu is one of the most prominent mountains in the world (20th) and towers over Borneo with its rocky summit. The hike has effectively no flat terrain so you're either ascending or descending at any point in time. The path is very steep, and feels like someone just set up the shortest possible route to the summit, rather than the usual zig-zag around the mountain approach.

However, it's totally worth it.

Most people do it in two days, ascending from around 1700m to the Laban Rata shelter at near 3300m on the first day, and then summitting on the second day and coming all the way down. This is what we did.

On the second day, guides (guides are a requirement here) recommend you leave early to catch the sunrise at the peak. I believe we woke up around 2am and walked up with our headlamps. 

The way to the summit is very steep, and for a good chunk of it there's a rope to be pulled on. The summit "plateau" is like something out of this world. There are various rocky summits sticking out, which from afar look like what I imagine Helgrind (mountain from the Eragon books) looks like.

Having watched the sunrise at the peak (which was beautiful!), we came down for breakfast at the shelter and continued on from there. The shelter is quite nice - you sleep in a room with about a dozen other people but things are clean and comfortable. There's no hot water though (or at least there wasn't when I was there) so you can take a shower, but it will hurt. It's usually pretty cold up there.
