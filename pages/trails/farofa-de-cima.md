# Cachoeira Farofa de Cima

[Trail link](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/brazil/minas-gerais/cachoeira-farofa-de-cima)

**Location:** Serra do Cipó, Brazil

**Length:** 14.5km

**Elevation gain:** 570m

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Twice, both in 2023.

My favorite Serra do Cipó hike so far. I've done it twice and even on weekends during the high season I haven't found many people on this trail. Perhaps I shouldn't be talking about it.

The trail is well-marked and starts off following the normal paved path most people take to the more popular waterfalls, but eventually cuts right where you cross the _Bocaína_ River. Usually this requires taking your shoes off but it's possible that that's not the case deep into the dry season.

After a few more kilometers walking on relatively flat terrain, the trail takes a sharp cut East and you begin ascending. A little bit before this spot I was once very lucky to see almost a dozen _Carcará_ hawks up on the rocks. I believe it was nesting season.

As you're going up, make sure to look back because the view is fantastic. Once you reach the top you'll be able to see the other side of the valley too. 

Nearing the waterfall, the trail splits up into two. The trail on the right takes you to the well, which is fantastic for swimming - both larger and deeper than you'd think! The one downside is that it barely gets sun, no matter the season. If you go left, however, after seemingly starting to go backwards into nowhere interesting, you'll reach the upper part of the waterfall. The view is great and there's a bit of space for swimming. From here I believe you could continue on and eventually reach the _Bandeirinhas_ canyon from above, but I haven't done this yet.

Overall a great trail.
