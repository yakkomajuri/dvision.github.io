# Hvannadalshnjúkur

[Trail link](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/iceland/eastern/hvannadalshnjukur)

**Location:** Vatnajökull Glacier, Iceland

**Peak height:** 2110m

**Trail length:** 28.5km

**Elevation gain:** ~2150m

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Once, in 2021.

Hvannadalshnjúkur is Iceland's highest point and requires a long day to ascend. Guide companies usually say the day will be between 12-16h long, and in our case I think we came back to the parking lot after around 12:30h on the trail (we were quite fast as a group). 

All in all, you ascend and descend over 2000m in one day, which is wild. I was told it is the most elevation gain on a summit day in Europe, which is probably true for normal people, since you have people like Kilian Jornet that go up Mont Blanc from Chamonix and get back in time for lunch.

The ascent is not really technical but you are traveling over glaciated terrain so you should be moving as a rope team. The final push to the summit is reasonably steep and here your ice axe will provide good support. 

When I went up, the weather was great in the sense that there was barely any wind (probably a first for Iceland, and this region in particular). The bad news is that we walked over thick fog for a good chunk of the day, and didn't really have a view from the summit (we were above the clouds, and there was nothing else also above them).

Overall it was a super enjoyable experience. It's a nice challenge and you do get some nice views lower on the mountain as well. The whole Vatnajökull area is fantastic, and this is a great way to get to know it!
