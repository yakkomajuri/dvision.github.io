# Pico do Itacolomi

[Trail link](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/brazil/minas-gerais/pico-do-itacolomi)

**Location:** Ouro Preto, Brazil

**Peak height:** 1772m

**Trail length:** 13-15km

**Elevation gain:** ~750m

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Once, in 2023.

This is one of my two favorite day hikes near my hometown Belo Horizonte, with the other being the [trail to the Farofa de Cima waterfall](/trails/farofa-de-cima).

The Itacolomi park is beautiful, with various types of vegetation merging together in ways I hadn't seen before. There are a few different trails up to the peak, and above I've linked one that is a bit longer but allows you to see a lot of the park, including the changes in vegetation.

Up on the peak on a clear day you'll have a 360Â° view of this historical region in Minas Gerais, as well as will be able to see some cool rock formations. Note that the big stone you see from afar is not the actual peak! 

There's a little waterfall down from the peak to the Ouro Preto side as well which is a nice stop on the way to and from the peak. Most people come from Ouro Preto to ascend the peak but it's also possible to go up from the Mariana side. I haven't done this yet but I've been told it's even nicer, although the trails are not as well-marked.
