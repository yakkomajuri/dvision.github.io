# Travessia Lençóis Maranhenses

(this trip deserves a better report, but this is a start)

**Location:** Maranhão, Brazil

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Once, in 2022.

Absolutely one of the best trails in the world. I can't provide exact information on length and elevation because these things aren't very accurate given you're walking over dunes. The numbers floated around most often are between 30-40km, but honestly I don't know. There are also a few different options for doing this in three or four days with different starting points.

Technically you could do this alone, but dangers aside, I think the logistics would be way too much hassle. I'm unsure how you'd sort out accommodation in the park. In our case, we went with a guide.

This trail traverses the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park in Maranhão, Brazil. It can be done from Atins to Santo Amaro or the other way around. I believe most people do the former. The park effectively feels like a desert, except that it has a near infinite amount of rainwater pools in its dunes. You spend your days walking on sand, up and down dunes, and sleep in small local communities within the park. These are located in what they call "oases", which are small patches of vegetation in the middle of the dunes. For sleeping arrangements, you sleep in hammocks in the houses of the native people from the area.

We started from Atins, where we took a boat down the _Preguiça_ river and then took a 4x4 that dropped us off somewhere in the middle of the park. From here, we walked (read: were on the trail) around 4 hours a day, with one day being a bit longer, I believe 6 hours. We walked for four days and ended the traverse in Santo Amaro. 

Every day you leave pretty early, such that you're walking while the sun is not too hot. You don't want to be walking very much past midday. On the longest day, I believe we woke up at around 4am. We watched the sunrise on all three mornings we spent in the park.

There's a lot more I need to write about this trip, but its highlights were:

- The landscape, which is unlike anything else in the world
- Running down massive dunes into the water
- Hearing the stories from the locals about their constant struggle against the sand (very Dune-like)
- One of the most beautiful night skies I've ever seen

This is a trail I highly recommend as it's a once in a lifetime experience. Walking in the scorching hot sun every day surely takes its toll, but with good protection and enough dips on the pools it can be managed pretty well.
