# Morro da Baleia

[Trail link](https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/morro-da-baleia-alto-paraiso-de-goias-pelo-camping-do-valdomiro-87156920) 

**Location:** Goiás, Brasil

**Peak height:** 1500m

**Trail length:** ~4km

**Elevation gain:** ~300m

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Once, in 2023.

This was one of the highlights of my trip to Chapada dos Veadeiros in Goiás, Brazil. A lot of the things in this area are reasonably crowded during the high season but we encountered nobody on this hike.

We went up there to see the sunset, which was a great idea and something I highly recommend. Do note though that the way up (and therefore the way down) is very steep, and includes loose rocks, roots, and gravel, which is particularly tricky if you're coming down with a headlamp after watching the sunset.

The hike itself is short, but as I mentioned, very steep, so it does tire you out quickly. Once up there there's a reasonably long plateau you can explore. From the main viewpoint you can get a great view over _Jardim de Maytrea_ and the sunset. We were also lucky to see quite a lot of birds, including a few different species of hawk.

If you park at _Waldomiro's_ camping, someone will charge you 20R$. They claim this is the fee for the trail but it's unclear to me whether they actually own the land. I suspect if you do not park your car there and just walk up to the trail (to the left, just before the parking) nobody will bother you.
