# Travessia Lapinha - Tabuleiro

[Trail link](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/brazil/minas-gerais/trilha-lapinha-tabuleiro-poco) (this is not the trail I followed, but an example of one of the ways to do the traverse)

**Location:** Minas Gerais, Brazil

**Length:** ~25km for just the traverse, up to ~40km if you go to both the well and the upper part of the _Tabuleiro_ waterfall

**Elevation gain:** ~650m for just the traverse, +200m if you go to the well

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Once, in 2023.

Lapinha - Tabuleiro is a classic traverse in Minas Gerais, ending up in one of Brazil's highest (273m high) and most impressive waterfalls, the _Tabuleiro_ waterfall.

The trail is fantastic and reasonably remote, and is usually completed in two to three days. If you skip the upper part of the waterfall, it's actually quite doable in a day.

There are quite a few different routes for this traverse. The link I shared above seemingly bypasses the _Lapinha_ peak through the North, but I actually bypassed the _Breu_ peak via the South when I did the traverse. It's also possible to do the traverse by going over the _Breu_ peak.

In my case, I left Belo Horizonte early in the morning and took a bus to Santana do Riacho, from where I hitchhiked twice in order to get to Lapinha. By the time I started the trail, I was already a bit tired and it was around 1pm, meaning the sun was as hot as can be. 

The start of the trail was the hardest part - the bulk of the elevation gain comes right at the start, and after that most of the trail is on plateaus up in the mountains, ending with a steep descent.

Wild camping is not allowed on the trail, with most of it going over private property. There were three open shelters on the trail when I did it, but it's best to ask someone in Lapinha about these before setting off, since it's very hard to get updated information about which shelters are open and which aren't. The first shelter is called _Ana Benta_ (often referred to as Lucas' shelter), and is around 9km in. It's slightly off-trail, so you need to be aware of this if you plan on staying there.

In my case, I stayed the first night in the _Chico Lages_ shelter, which is about 13km in. I did the trail during the week and they weren't really prepared for receiving people, so that's something to be aware of. I was carrying a tent and all the food I needed, so I just needed to be shown where to camp and I was good. They did mention they could have cooked some food if I needed it, but weren't really expecting it, so that's something to account for if you're planning on not carrying food with you.

The next shelter (_Zé's_ shelter) is just 2km further, and it seemed better prepared for receiving visitors. I saw some people had slept in beds here. By the way, it's worth noting that these are not primarily shelters, but rather farms from people that live in the area. For the record, the standard prices when I went were 40R$ for camping and 90R$ for camping and food at all shelters. I'm not sure how much a bed goes for.

My second day was reasonably light. I got a good amount of rain (despite it being the dry season), and when I arrived at the first viewpoint for the waterfall, it was covered in clouds. 

I made my way to the park entrance and waited out the rain while chatting to the guards. Just by doing this traverse they should charge you 20R$, but I was initially let off the hook on a technicality. Since it was raining, I hadn't "enjoyed" the viewpoint I passed by, so he said I didn't need to pay the fee. Once the sky cleared and I decided to visit the well, he charged me the fee.

I left my big bag at the office and went to the well light. This was a good call, since once you get down to the river you need to scramble and jump from rock to rock, which gets slippery after rain. The well is fantastic - it's around 20m deep at its deepest, and as wide as an olympic swimming pool. Oh, and if f you like climbing, there are a few routes up the waterfall walls.

Leaving the trail is perhaps the most difficult part. You arrive in _Tabuleiro_, which is a tiny village, and need to get to _Conceição do Mato Dentro_ in order to get a bus or a taxi anywhere. When I did the trail, the only buses from _Tabuleiro_ to _Conceição_ would leave early on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In my case, I managed to hitch a ride from a couple down to _Serra do Cipó_, where I camped for the night. I then took a bus back to Belo Horizonte the next day.
