# Snæfellsjökull

[Trail link](https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/snaefellsjokull-6904907) 

**Location:** Snaefellsness Peninsula, Iceland

**Peak height:** 1446m

**Trail length:** ~8km

**Elevation gain:** ~800m

**Number of times I've done this trail:** Once, in 2022.

In Jules Verne's *Journey to the Center of the Earth*, it is believed that the door to the center of the Earth lies in Snæfellsjökull. Snæfellsjökull is a glacier that houses a volcano, yet if there's a passage at the top it's nicely covered in ice.

It's reasonably-ish common for Icelanders to go up to the top of Snæfellsjökull, many on skis. If you're walking, it's a reasonably steep walk over glaciated terrain with ice axe, crampons, and rope being needed - I can attest that there are crevasses!

At the top you should have a nice view, but we were completely in the clouds when I went there so didn't really see much. There are a few ice formations at the top that you can climb on top of if you have a bit of experience in more technical ice climbing. These are the little "ears" of the glacier that you can see from afar, as I would see out of the window from Gardabaer when the sky was clear.
