# Retirement

Yesterday I was speaking to a gardener. He said: "I've sent my papers in for retirement. Man, I told my wife, if I retire, I'll start working 4-day weeks. No more Fridays."

And today I overheard the following conversation at lunch: "Oh you mean retire retire? You'll actually stop working? Nice!"

The word retirement here just means getting approved for your pension. True retirement is a luxury.
