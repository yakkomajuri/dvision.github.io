# Why I'm comfortable publishing foolishness

When I started, I was very insecure.

Well, still am.

You'll find disclaimers, apologies, explanations, and the like all over my writing.

As much as I'd prefer not to, I, like most, care about others think.

And so it goes, I publish an article, it gains some traction, and I find myself making edit after edit to please the angry internet mob.

But ultimately, I publish that _thang_.

I write about a lot of shit. Anything that interests me at at given moment, really. 

Often times the topic is something I have no proper knowledge in.

I've written about tech, business, linguistics, self-development, football, and a bunch else.

And sometimes I dabble where I "shouldn't", like trying to determine the [world's most efficient language](blog/language-efficiency) - over a weekend and without any formal knowledge of linguistics.

My ventures into uncharted territory sometimes go well, and other times poorly. But the thing I always take away from it is a lot of fresh knowledge.

You see, I cannot just read a book to learn something. I must get my hands dirty, play around, formulate hypotheses, and challenge my own assumptions.

Thus, when I write about an unfamiliar topic, I'm putting my assumptions to the test - both during the writing process, when I'm forced to learn more, and after publishing, when others inevitably teach me more about it.

It's quite  for someone to teach me something by seeing my assumptions presented and rationally breaking them down than for them
