# Heart attack prevention

In one of my first classes ever at university, the professor gave us a little personality quiz to do.

It wasn't Myers-Briggs or Big 5, it was something else.

I don't remember anything about my results except for one thing: it said I was likely to have my first heart attack at 45.

It wasn't anything eye-opening at the time, but this came back to me recently as I was asked, yet again:

> _"Do you ever chill?"_

I brushed the question off but it did get me thinking about how I'm living my life and what unintended consequences it can have.

So I thought I'd stop for a bit and devise a plan for myself going forward.

Things I should aim for and can look back to in order to see how I'm doing.

Not only do I absolutely not want to have a heart attack at 45, but, more importantly, the same approach to life that has the early heart attack as a consequence also brings other consequences I'd like to be better prepared for.
