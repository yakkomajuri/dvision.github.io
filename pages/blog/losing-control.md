# Losing control

I logged into Zoom and started the meeting. We ran through a round of intros and after that I started explaining our product.

Suddenly, blank. I couldn't think. 

I started to sweat, my heart was racing, and my voice was trembly.

I excused myself and made my way to the bathroom. I wet my face and took a few sips of water.

I eventually joined the call again and it was painful to see it through to the end.

Did I just have a panic attack?

Since way back in high school, I was always comfortable going up and speaking in front of people. 

I remember being a mildly feared debate opponent, and pitching a course I was leading to two entire grades. 

Since then, I've gone on a path that has often put me on stage in front of people. 

I've done over 50 talks, speaking to audiences of up to hundreds of people, including presenting a paper at the European Central Bank, where I was by far the youngest person in the room.

And now, since picking up my last job, I've done hundreds of product demos to other companies - some being massive publicly listed companies.

And yet, despite all this, after the incident I mentioned at the beginning, I spent months having mild panic attacks before every call I joined. 

And I'm not just talking about demos either. Casual chats with a single coworker would trigger the same response.
