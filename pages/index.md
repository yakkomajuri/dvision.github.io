    <summary>What is this website?</summary>
    <p>
    This <s>is</s> hopefuly will be where I host my "stream of
    consciousness" blog. My more structured and education-focused
    technical writing can still be found
    <a href="https://yakkomajuri.medium.com/">here</a>.

    <summary>Why is it called 'Sunday Afternoon'?</summary>
    <p>
    Sunday afternoons are often when I'm most contemplative, as well as
    when I generally have the most time to spare. They have
    traditionally been when I develop my best concepts for writing, so
    the blog name felt appropriate. The bulk of the time I spend on this
    blog will also probably happen on sunday afternoons.

### Blog

Raw pieces comprising what I'm thinking about at a given point in time. Barely edited, often written quickly in one go. 

- [Be careful with Heroku Postgres](blog/heroku-postgres)
- [The hiker's goal](blog/the-hikers-goal)
- [Hiking around Andorra in 5 days](blog/coronallacs)
- [YC owns the product analytics space](blog/yc-product-analytics)
- [Why I built my own static site generator](blog/teeny)
- [What's the cost?](blog/whats-the-cost)

### Pictures

As someone who does not have a social media presence, I'll be using this blog to display some of my favorite pictures. Currently work in progress - more albums coming soon.

- [5 Days in the Andorran Mountains (2021)](/pics/coronallacs)
- [Hong Kong Protests (2019)](/pics/hk)

### Post ideas

Ideas for posts that I may or may not write. It feels like having them here would make me more likely to write them at some point.
