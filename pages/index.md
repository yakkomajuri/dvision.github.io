    <summary>What is this website?</summary>
    <p>
    This is <s>hopefuly will be</s> where I host my "stream of
    consciousness" blog. My more structured and education-focused
    technical writing can still be found
    <a href="https://yakkomajuri.medium.com/">here</a>.

    <summary>Why is it called 'Sunday Afternoon'?</summary>
    <p>
    Sunday afternoons are often when I'm most contemplative, as well as
    when I generally have the most time to spare. They have
    traditionally been when I develop my best concepts for writing, so
    the blog name felt appropriate. The bulk of the writing for this
    blog will also probably happen on sunday afternoons.

    <summary>Contact</summary>
    <p>
    If you're a recruiter for a full-time role, the <b>one and only way</b> of getting a hold of me is through <a href="/recruit-me">here</a>. I ignore all LinkedIn messages and emails from recruiters.
    </p>
    <p>
    For all other reasons, you can reach me at:
    </p>
    <div style="font-size:14px">
        <code>yakko [dot] majuri [at] protonmail [dot] com</code>
    </div>
    <p>
    If you'd like to work with me on a consultancy / freelance basis please make that known in the subject of the email so it doesn't risk being ignored like the messages about full-time roles.

As someone who does not have a social media presence, I'll be using this blog to display some of my favorite pictures. Currently work in progress - more albums coming soon.
