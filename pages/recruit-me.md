If you believe I'm a great fit for an open role you have, filling out the form below is **the only way** to ensure there's actually a chance I'll get back to you.

At the moment, I'm happy at my current job and not looking for a change. As a result, I noticed that I have not replied to a single recruiting message for a role for quite a while. 

Effectively, recruiters have had a 0% success rate in getting me to engage. 

However, while I am not looking for a change, I'd like to give recruiters a chance to make their case. 

It's entirely possible that there's a role out there that truly is "made for me" - and if you really believe that, it should be no problem to adhere to this stupid requirement of mine.
