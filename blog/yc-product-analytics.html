<p>I saw a tweet the other day that said YCombinator "dominates the product analytics category".</p>
<p>This is indeed true. YC has invested in all the top players in the product analytics space: Mixpanel (S09), Amplitude (W12), and Heap (W13). </p>
<p>Not only that, it continues to invest in companies in this space like PostHog (W20) - disclaimer: I work here - and June (W21).</p>
<p>But the interesting thing to me is that YC is not just betting on this trend/industry. It's creating the market as well, and that's where the dominance lies.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies come through YC each year. During the batch they learn about how to build a successful company, from YC's perspective. </p>
<p>So, what if YC tells a batch that product analytics is an essential piece of building a modern business? Well, the whole space has now just gained a few hundred promising startups as new clients - most of which will fail, but a few of which are bound to become unicorns (and then pay Amplitude 6 figures a year).</p>
<p>While B2C YCombinator companies need to go out into the world, a significant portion of the future market for B2B companies like product analytics ones is right there, inside YC.</p>
<p>And that's not all - YC companies are looked up to all over the world, so their practices influence tons of other companies. If a YC company is using product analytics, I should use it too.</p>
<p>Thus, YC is betting on the space and driving it forward at the same time. Of course, this is the general idea with any trend, but it is particularly apparent here.</p>
<p>Going even further, there are adjacent investments that have also been a fundamental piece here. To teach startups about analytics, who does YC invite? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLerCc7MOQo">Segment (S11)</a>: the top CDP to deliver data into tools like product analytics platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you use X or Y for product analytics, it doesn't matter. Somehow someway YC gains from it. </p>
<p>Plus, at the end of the day, you might only feel you need product analytics because of YC in the first place.</p>
<p>So that's it for this piece. I just wanted to quickly jot down some thoughts about what a great investment strategy looks like.</p>
<p>Final note: with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/twilio-acquires-segment">Segment's acquistion</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/amplitude-starts-trading-on-nasdaq-in-direct-listing.html">Amplitude's recent IPO</a>, it seems like the bets in this space are starting to pay off.</p>
