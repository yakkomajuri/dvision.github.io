<p><em>...duly flagged as such, of course.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>23/01/2022</em></p>
<p>When I started, I was very insecure.</p>
<p>Well, still am.</p>
<p>You'll find disclaimers, apologies, explanations, and the like all over my writing.</p>
<p>As much as I'd prefer not to, I, like most, care about others think.</p>
<p>And so it goes, I publish an article, it gains some traction, and I find myself making edit after edit to please the angry internet mob.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I publish that <em>thang</em>.</p>
<p>I write about a lot of shit. Anything that interests me at at given moment, really.</p>
<p>Often times the topic is something I have no proper knowledge in.</p>
<p>I've written about tech, business, linguistics, self-development, football, and a bunch else.</p>
<p>And sometimes I dabble where I "shouldn't", like trying to determine the <a href="blog/language-efficiency">world's most efficient language</a> - over a weekend and without any formal knowledge of linguistics.</p>
<p>My ventures into uncharted territory sometimes go well, and other times poorly. But the thing I always take away from it is a lot of fresh knowledge.</p>
<p>You see, I cannot just read a book to learn something. I must get my hands dirty, play around, formulate hypotheses, and challenge my own assumptions.</p>
<p>Thus, when I write about an unfamiliar topic, I'm putting my assumptions to the test - both during the writing process, when I'm forced to learn more, and after publishing, when others inevitably teach me more about it.</p>
<p>So when the comments pour in, I attain a lot of knowledge that's more likely to stick. My claims are debated and assumptions checked, and I come out of the endeavor with a greater understanding of a topic that I was interested in.</p>
<p>Can't be afraid to be wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, the posts of mine that get the most traction are those where I know very well what I'm talking about. But it's not fun to just stick to those. Plus traction on this blog here is just an ego metric - it's not like I make money out of it.</p>
<p>And, finally, I also hold the belief that <em>everyone</em> has <em>something</em> to add to <em>any</em> discussion. So there you go, you'll certainly be hearing my bit.</p>
