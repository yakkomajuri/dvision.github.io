        <div id="page-content"><h1 id="can-you-tell-me-the-age-of-my-users">Can you tell me the age of my users?</h1>
<p>I once had an onboarding call with a client where I was asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Can you tell me the age of my users?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm an engineer at an analytics company, and upon getting asked that question I was immediately taken aback.</p>
<p>It sounded like such a stupid question - how could we possibly infer that?</p>
<p>And then it clicked: this client was migrating off of Google Analytics.</p>
<p>You see, Google <em>can</em> and <em>does</em> provide age information in their analytics dashboard.</p>
<p>They can do that because countless websites across the world use Google Analytics and even more people use Google services.</p>
<p>Google can then cross-reference all the data they get and spit out a reasonably accurate guess as to the age of the users that go to your website.</p>
<p>Not only that - Google is not an analytics company. They're an ads company.</p>
<p>So the same model of your users from which they derive some of the information that appears on your dashboard is used to do very targeted advertising all across the web.</p>
<p>And that's ultimately the problem with Google Analytics particularly.</p>
<p>We can discuss the nuances of GDPR, sending data to servers in other countries, etc.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, the biggest problem with Google Analytics is that it is a service provided by a company whose end product is <em>not</em> analytics.</p>
<p>So, from a user privacy perspective, you're probably better off with a company that provides analytics as their core product, however that's done.</p>

<p><em>Please note that I'm a very biased source. I work for PostHog, a company that isn't a direct competitor to Google Analytics per se, but also kind of is.</em></p>
<p><em>But my argument here is that, as long as you're compliant with local laws, you could switch to a cloud-based service like Mixpanel or Amplitude and it'd still be an improvement. Even though, as you'd expect, I'm an advocate for self-hosted analytics.</em></p>
