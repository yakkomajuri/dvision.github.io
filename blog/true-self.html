<p>Many years ago I received a letter that, among other things, provided me with some advice. Part of that advice was:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Drink less coffee [...] and read some fiction"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer was someone acutely aware of my approach to life, and my constant struggle to "turn off".</p>
<p>So while my coffee consumption remains high, I have taken up the second bit of advice. </p>
<p>After 6 or so years, I started slow. I picked up <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. </p>
<p>Fiction, sure. </p>
<p>But not the kind that helps me escape this world and ease my mind. More like the opposite.</p>
<p>So around a year after that, I decided to tap into my inner child and read something that's more "pure fiction": fantasy.</p>
<p>I started by following up on my childhood reading, and devoured <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> in like a day.</p>
<p>Then I picked up the <em>Inheritance Cycle</em> series, also known as "the Eragon books".</p>
<p>While that did help me turn off my mind for a bit, I couldn't help myself but using a particular concept from the book as self-reflection.</p>
<h2 id="true-names">True names</h2>
<p>In this magical world Paolini created, there is an "ancient language" in which everything that is spoken is true.</p>
<p>This language uses the "true names" of all things, which are names that encompass the very essence of things and beings. </p>
<p>To know someone's true name is to have a deep and complete understanding of who they really are, and such knowledge also brings some power.</p>
<p>This concept struck a chord with me, and my reflection was intensified during a recent conversation with my father, where he said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"There's who you think you are, and who you really are. And the key is narrowing that gap."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The books (<strong>spoiler alert</strong>) address this topic as well.</p>
<p>At some point, Eragon, the main character, begins a search for his true name.</p>
<p>He finds this extremely difficult, as it requires him to confront who he <em>really</em> is, including the parts of himself he's not proud of. </p>
<p>Ultimately, after a lot of self-reflection, he understands who he really is. And while he's happy for having done so, he's also slightly disappointed at what he's found. </p>
<p>His true self is flawed and different from what he thought it was, and it is a difficult thing to accept it.</p>
<h2 id="my-true-self">My true self</h2>
<p>Through my own "soul searching", I've found this gap to be at the root of a lot of the anxiety I might have about certain things.</p>
<p>For example, I will at times find myself being jealous of something that, if I really come to think about, I do not really want for myself.</p>
<p>I have developed an image of myself, attached a bunch of labels to it, and feel threatened when I encounter a conflict between this image and who I really am. </p>
<p>The "thing" I might yearn for or be jealous of makes sense in the context of the image I've created, but my innate resistance to it leads to an internal clash.</p>
<p>"I want this but I don't" - and my mind struggles to reconcile with this reality.</p>
<p>Another issue is that, unlike what happened to Eragon, there's no magical empowerment that comes from understanding the depths of yourself. </p>
<p>Who knows what's on the other side of this painful path? </p>
<p>It's an easy task to accept the good, but the bad and the ugly parts of yourself are hard truths to embrace. </p>
<p>And then there's the fact that when Eragon learns his true name, a magical feeling makes his body vibrate when he says it out loud.</p>
<p>We, on the other hand, don't have the benefit of such a sign.</p>
<p>The search is one for an imaginary goal post, one so abstract that it might not exist at all - is there such a thing as someone's true self?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel the journey is a worthy one. </p>
<p>On occasion, I can sense pieces of my true self creeping to the surface as I reflect on my feelings. </p>
<p>Yet simply allowing my mind explore them is a difficult task, so that often the choice I make is to leave them alone. Accepting them might mean breaking down a lot of what I thought I knew about who I am, a scary proposition.</p>
<p>But perhaps, if I just got myself to look at that mirror for a brief moment...</p>
